# XRayCalib
Automatic segmentation and labelling of fiducial markers for X-ray calibration. The file CCalibration.py contains two classes, XRaySeg helps in the segmentation, contouring and visualization of the X-Ray images,
while CCalibration helps handle the computation of DLT parameters and evaluation of the calibration.

Currently, the code is optimized to be used with Surgivisio phantom from [eCential Robotics](https://www.ecential-robotics.com/en).
